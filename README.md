# WeatherMod

Simple Angular web project to show current weather data based on the inputs given by the user.

API used: https://www.weatherapi.com/

I have hidden all api related data from the project... please populate the fields yourself.

to populate create a account and subscribe to the api in weatherapi.com
then goto src/app/services/weather.services.ts and all all headers and url from the api that you got when you subscribed to the api in weatherapi.com

I personally used rapidapi.com to get weatherapi.com's api you can also follow the same method or continue with the one I mentioned above.
